# Survey form with React
I have made a post Covid-19 survey for the stage arts field with React, this weeks we were learning use form fields, and how to use useState with React to show different components based on where the user are in the survey.
## The problem
I started building all of the Components first. I should probably have tried them out one by one, before connecting them. This caused a lot of problems because initially the first question did not lead on to the second question and so on. 

I then had a code coaching session on Wednesday which together with Wednesday's lecture helped me understand and solve the problem. My next problem was moving on from question 2 til question 3. I asked a question in the public Stack overflow when I was really tired and blind due to starring on the code for too many hours. Reading questions on Stack overflow helped me understand this weeks project in more detail, and I have asked google and a fresh pair of eyes to look at my code.

If I had more time I would continue adding popup messages for the Components, and use the defaultState and currentState to decide upon if those messages would be shown to the user. I would also add a header and a footer Component and be more meticulous about the styling. This week I have a real lack of time, since I am working a lot at my breadjob so all of those things needs to be taken care of later.
