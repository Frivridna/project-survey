# Survey form with React
I have made a post Covid-19 survey for the stage arts field with React, this weeks we were learning use form fields, and how to use useState with React to show different components based on where the user are in the survey.
## The problem
I started out by building all of the Components, then the problem was that initially the first question did not lead on to the second question and so on. 

Reading questions on Stack overflow together with Wednesday's lecture helped me understand this weeks project in more detail, and I have asked google and a fresh pair of eyes to look at my code.

If I had more time I would style for tablet mode, and figure out how to limit user choices on checkboxes. I would also add a header and a footer Component and be more meticulous about the styling in general. This week I have a real lack of time, since I am working a lot at my breadjob so all of those things needs to be taken care of later.
