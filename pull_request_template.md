My reflections on how this week's project turned out:
I would have liked to customize my Survey more, doing a header and a footer and perhaps a progress bar to show the user where in the survey they were. But as it is right now I am ok with the result. 

Mentioned in the README: 
"Wednesday's code coaching and lecture clarified a lot of things to me! :) If I had more time I would continue adding popup messages for the Components, and use the defaultState and currentState to decide upon if those messages would be shown to the user. This week I have a real lack of time, since I am working a lot at my breadjob so all of those things needs to be taken care of later."

Things I'd like to have clarified or explained in more detail:
How to work with checkboxes - can I only make it possible for a user to select a limited amount of checkboxes? 
Other input types that I did not try out this time.
